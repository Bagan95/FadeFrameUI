# FadeFrameUI
Lightweight addon that changes the transparency of the player frame, minimap, action bars and buff icon based on the following conditions:    
- Out of combat, no target and full health/mana

This addon will hopefully make you more immersed in to the game and also prevent burn in on OLED-monitors. 

# This is 20% (default) transparency.

![No Target](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13dff91d-ebca-440a-86d0-f4474ef87424)

# This is 100% (default) transparency.
