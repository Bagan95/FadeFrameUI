# FadeFrameUI - 1.12.1 and Turtle WoW 1.17.2
Lightweight addon that changes the transparency of the player frame, pet frame, minimap, action bars and buff icons based on the following conditions:    
- Out of combat, no target and full health/mana

This addon will hopefully make you more immersed in to the game and also prevent burn in on OLED-monitors. 

# This is 20% (default) transparency.

# How To Download And Install The Addon
Press on the green button "<> Code" top right corner or press directly here [Download](https://github.com/Bagan95/FadeFrameUI/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

Under "Local" press on "Download ZIP"

Extract the FadeFrameUI-main.zip or FadeFrameUI-1.X.X.zip file (depending where you download from) to your WoW folder where you have your addons installed "\Interface\AddOns"
